# Capstone-CS1-1
## Project Introduction
**Project number:** CS1

**Project Source:** School of Civil Engineering / Truji Pty Ltd

**Project Title:** Neighbourhood Walk - Bridging the gap within the community

**Project Description and Scope:** 

To create an application that enables 'Parents'
to register their interest for a neighbourhood walker, and for 'Walkers/ (people
who live within the neighbourhood), to register their interest in walking
children who are in primary school, to school. When a parent is able to find
their walker on the app, and the walker accepts the walk, a Neighbourhood
Walk is enabled.

**Expected outcomes/deliverables:** 

Website / Mobile App prototype with capabilities for self-registration and identity verification for both parents and
walker. The site/app should also help facilitate the search / advertising of the
walk and to help connect the two parties into agreeing to a walk agreement.
The user registration needs to be easy and seamless, with integrations to
existing identity verification systems to check things like home address,
working with children check, or even existing identity credential providers like
MyGov ID.

**Specific required knowledge, skills, and/or technology:**

• Mobile App development skills (flexible on any native or hybrid
development frameworks).
• Web Development skills (front end and some back-end development
skills required for the main use cases).
• Identity and Access Management / Identity Verification and integration
with existing Identity Proofing / Credentials providers.
• AI / Machine Learning will be a bonus to help pair and match parents /
walkers.

**Fields that this project may involve:** 
Web Development; Software
Development; Security/Networks; Cloud Computing; Mobile App
Development.

**Resources provided by the client:** 

We can provide any cloud services or
development tools if required.
The students need to find a dataset.

**后端文件解释

对于每个function有三个java文件,一个与数据表有相同结构的实体类；一个映射器（Mapper）；一个Controller。
1. Java 实体类：例如创建一个 PreMeeting 类，该类具有与数据库中 Premeeting 表的每个字段相对应的属性，还包括一些基本的变量Set和Get方法。
2. 创建映射器： 创建一个扩展 BaseMapper 的接口 MeetingMapper，用于对数据库进行 CRUD，BaseMapper 可以提供一些基本的 CRUD 方法，为特殊情况需要自定义一些方法。
3. 控制器： 创建控制器与映射器交互，对指定表执行 CRUD 操作，并为这些操作生成 Resful api 端点。
